Addition

x1, y1, x2, y2 <- x and y dimensions of the input two matrices

if x1 != x2 or y1 != y2
return can't add

x <- x1
y <- y1

for every x
    for every y
	 new matrix[x, y] <- matrix1[x, y] + matrix2[x, y]

return new matrix



Subtraction

x1, y1, x2, y2 <- x and y dimensions of the two input matrices

for 1 to x
    for 1 to y
	 new matrix[x, y] <- matrix1[x, y] - matrix2[x, y]

Multiplication

x1, y1, x2, y2 <- x and y dimensions of the two matrices

if y1 != x1
return can't multiply
